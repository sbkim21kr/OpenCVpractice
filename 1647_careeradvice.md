### 1️⃣ Search for foreign-based companies with Seoul branches using “SolidWorks”
This is smart because:

Foreign companies often value diverse backgrounds, English proficiency, and international experience — all of which you have.

“SolidWorks” is a specific, in-demand skill in mechanical design and manufacturing. Using it as a keyword helps you target relevant roles.

These companies may have more flexible hiring practices and be open to mid-career professionals.

💡 Tip: Try searching on LinkedIn, Google, and even company career pages directly. Use phrases like:

“SolidWorks jobs Seoul”

“Mechanical design engineer SolidWorks Seoul”

“Foreign companies hiring SolidWorks Korea”

### 2️⃣ Search for a headhunter
This is helpful because:

Headhunters can match you with roles that aren’t publicly listed.

They often work with companies looking for specific profiles, and your mix of engineering, math, business, and training could be a match.

Some specialize in mid-career transitions or technical placements.

💡 Tip: Look for headhunters on LinkedIn or search for recruiting firms in Korea that specialize in engineering or manufacturing. You can message them directly with a short intro.

### 3️⃣ Use LinkedIn instead of sites like JobKorea
This is probably the most important advice:

JobKorea and similar sites are application-heavy — you apply, wait, and hope.

LinkedIn is visibility-heavy — you build a profile, tell your story, and recruiters come to you.

It’s especially powerful for someone with a non-linear career path — you can explain your journey and show your current direction.

💡 Tip: Post a short story about your career change, your training, and what kind of role you’re looking for. Use hashtags like #careerchange #SolidWorks #MES #manufacturing.

🧠 Bottom Line
Your teacher is guiding you toward proactive visibility, not just passive job hunting. That’s exactly what works best for someone like you — with a rich background, new skills, and a story worth telling.
