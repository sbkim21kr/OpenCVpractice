# Let's simplify that. i for i in ... is a core part of Python's list comprehension, a compact way to create lists.

# Think of it as a shorthand for a for loop that builds a new list.

Here's the structure:

    [expression for item in iterable if condition]

And here is how it maps to your code:

    [i for i in dir(cv2) if 'EVENT' in i]

Part of the Code	What It Represents
i	The item to put in the new list.
for i in	The start of the loop.
dir(cv2)	The iterable (the list of all names in cv2).
if 'EVENT' in i	The condition that filters which items are included.

The i for i part is where a value is taken from a list and then put into the new list. It's a bit like saying, "For every item in this list, take that same item and put it in a new list."

# So, the whole thing reads as: "Create a list that contains i for every i in the list of cv2 names, but only if the string 'EVENT' is in i."
