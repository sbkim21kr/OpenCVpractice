Since the venv folder wasn't cloned, you need to recreate it on the Windows machine.

    Open your project in VS Code.

    Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ``).

    Create the new virtual environment for Windows:
    python -m venv venv

    

    Install your dependencies. This is where the requirements.txt file you created comes in handy!
    pip install -r requirements.txt
