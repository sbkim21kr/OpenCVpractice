# The reshape((-1, 1, 2)) method is changing the shape of your array of points from a 2D array to a 3D array. This is necessary because many OpenCV functions that draw or manipulate polygons, like cv2.polylines, expect the points to be in a specific 3D format: (number_of_points, 1, 2).

Here's a breakdown of the parameters:

    -1: This is a placeholder that tells NumPy to automatically calculate the size of this dimension based on the total number of elements in the original array. If your pts array has N points, this will become N. For example, if you have 4 points, the shape will become (4, 1, 2).

    1: This creates a new, single dimension in the middle. This is a requirement for some OpenCV functions, which need an extra dimension for handling multiple contours or sets of points.

    2: This ensures that each element in the array is a pair of coordinates, (x, y). The original pts array likely had a shape of (N, 2), where N is the number of points and each row is a pair of (x, y) coordinates.

# In short, the reshape method is converting a list of (x, y) coordinate pairs into the specific format that OpenCV's drawing functions expect.
