## Step-by-Step Linux Workflow

# 1.   Open your project in VS Code on Linux.

# 2. Open the terminal and navigate to your project folder.

# 3. Pull the latest changes. This command fetches the changes from the remote repository on GitHub and merges them with your local branch.

### Bash

### git pull

You will see a message confirming that the changes have been pulled.

# 4. Start coding. Now that your project is up-to-date, you can safely continue your work.

# 5. Add, commit, and push your new changes. When you're ready to save and sync your work, follow the standard three-step process:
Bash

###    git add .
### git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"
###    git push

Following this simple git pull before you start working and git push after you finish working will prevent most synchronization issues between your two machines.
